            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is the entire reason Watchtower exists. Our commitment is to provide you with powerful security insights without ever compromising your personal data. This policy outlines exactly what information the extension handles and, more importantly, what it does not.</p>

            <h2>The Core Principle: Local-First Analysis</h2>
            <p>The fundamental design of Watchtower is to perform all sensitive analysis directly on your computer. <strong>Your list of extensions, their permissions, and your Browse activity are never transmitted to our servers or any third party.</strong></p>

            <h2>Information We Handle</h2>
            <p>To provide its features, Watchtower needs to access certain types of information. Here is a transparent breakdown of what we access and how it's handled:</p>

            <h3>1. Installed Extension Data (Analyzed Locally)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we access:</strong> The extension scans the names, versions, and permissions of your other installed browser extensions.</p>
            <p><strong>Why we access it:</strong> This is the core function of Watchtower. This data is used to calculate a privacy score, generate plain-English explanations of permissions, and display them to you in the extension popup.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong> This analysis happens <strong>entirely on your local machine</strong>. This information is never sent over the internet.</p>

            <h3>2. Browse Activity (Analyzed Locally and in Real-Time)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we access:</strong> The extension checks the URL of the website in your currently active tab.</p>
            <p><strong>Why we access it:</strong> This is required for two key features: to show you which of your extensions are currently active on the page you're visiting, and to trigger the in-page alert if a high-risk extension is active on a sensitive website. For premium users, this is also used to automatically disable extensions on websites you have configured.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong> This check is performed in real-time. <strong>Your Browse history is not stored, logged, or transmitted.</strong></p>

            <h3>3. User-Created Configuration (Stored Locally)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we access:</strong> The extension stores the "Profiles" and "Monitored Sites" that you create for the premium features.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong> This configuration is saved using Chrome's built-in storage API, which is private and local to your browser profile. It is never transmitted externally.</p>

            <h3>4. Anonymous Payment Status (Third-Party Service)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we access:</strong> To manage premium "Suite" features, the extension uses a third-party payment service, ExtensionPay. When you use the extension, it communicates with ExtensionPay's servers using an anonymous ID to check if you are a free or paid user.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong> We do not send any personal information, Browse data, or your list of extensions to ExtensionPay. The service only knows an anonymous ID and its payment status. Payments are processed securely by Stripe via ExtensionPay.</p>

            <h3>5. Service Data (Non-Personal)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we access:</strong> For the "Context-Aware" feature, the extension displays the icon (favicon) of the websites you monitor. To do this, it sends the domain name (e.g., "google.com") to a public Google service to fetch the icon.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong> This request does not include any personal information about you or your account.</p>
